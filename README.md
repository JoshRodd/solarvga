# solarvga

v0.9.1  
4 January 2025

## Introduction

This is an implementation of [Ethan Schoonover's
Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) for DOS and IBM PC compatibles
that have a VGA card (including virtual machines, emulators, or environments like
DOSBox).

## Warning

Version 0.9.1 has a bug in its .SYS driver and does not work. The .COM TSR works
properly.

## Compatibility

Compatible with MS-DOS 1.00 or PC-DOS 1.00 and up alongside a VGA or 100% compatible.
It does not check if a VGA is installed, although using it will probably result in
nothing harmful happening.

## Using

It can be run as a TSR (optionally with `LOADHIGH`), or installed as a device driver
(on DOS 2.00 or newer). Installing as a device driver saves approximately 208 bytes
of memory. The device driver can be installed with `DEVICEHIGH`, and consumes
approximately 176 bytes of memory.

You can add it to `CONFIG.SYS` with something like this:

```
DEVICE=A:\SOLARVGA.COM
```

or to `AUTOEXEC.BAT` like this:

```
@A:\SOLARVGA
```

The program can be removed from resident memory by running `SOLARVGA /U`. Note that
on DOS versions prior to 2.00, the memory cannot be freed when uninstalled.

## Building

Run `make`, `MAKE.BAT`, or `make.sh`; requires nasm, although it will also build
with [A86](http://eji.com/a86/). Note that `SOLARVGA.COM` and `SOLARVGA.SYS` are
identical.
